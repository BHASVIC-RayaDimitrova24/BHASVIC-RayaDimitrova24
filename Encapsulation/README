This task was an introduction to using encapsulation in Java. In the program customers check in and out of hotal rooms and can leave feedback. 

I used the non-encapsulated code on the "Introduction to OOP" course on Zig Zag education and encapsulated it. This was useful for me as it taught me good programming practises what I still use.
