## Raya Dimitrova

I am a BHASVIC student studying Computer Science, Business and Graphic Design A-Levels.

My professional goals are to study Computer Science and AI at the University of Sussex and become a programmer.

I am mostly interested in the AI sector and am currently writing an EPQ dissertation about the effect of AI on eveyday life.

I am currently working on my programming coursework project, where I am making a game in Greenfoot using Java.

I studied Computer Science for GCSEs and got a Grade 9.

In BHASVIC I have completed many group programming projects which helped me to gain soft skills such as communication and teamwork.
