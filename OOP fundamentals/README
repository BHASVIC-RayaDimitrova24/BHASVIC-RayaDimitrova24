This exerice was my introduction to OOP programming. It helped me to learn how OOP differs from procedural and how to implement classes, attributes, methods and constructors in code.

I used the skeleton code in the "Introduction to OOP Java Edition" course on ZigZag Education and created a fully-functioning bank account system.
