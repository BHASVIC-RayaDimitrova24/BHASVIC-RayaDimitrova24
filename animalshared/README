This is a group project to make a version of Monopoly in Java.

I worked on the Cards, Animal and Player classes and my team member programmed the Board and Dice. 

I found this project extremely useful, not only because it helped me to improve on my Java skills, but beacuse it taught me about the importance of communication and collaboration when working as a team.
